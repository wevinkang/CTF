Viewing the page source of the website or looking in inspector gives us 1/3 of the flag: 
  	<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

Next, looking in style editor, bottom of mycss.csss gives uf flag 2/3:
  /* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

On the website, we're given a hint and can assume that flag 3/3 should be in JS.
"How I used these to make this site:
HTML
CSS
JS (JavaScript) "

Checked debugger, myjs.js, found 
  /* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */

Put the flags together.

Flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}
