Viewing page source shows first part of flag:
  	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->

Style editor, mycss.ss reveals second flag. Similar to the last flag challenge called inspector.
  /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */

Thought it'd be the same as the last, so I checked the JS code again in myjs.js:
  /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */

This isn't the flag, but tells us the robots.txt directory should be checked next which was right.
  # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
  # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?

Got stuck here for a bit looking for common apacher server files, but no luck. Came across the tool, dirbuster that can give us all the publicly available files.
  dirsearch -u mercury.picoctf.net:27278

Sort of out of order, but just but the flags together. 

Flag: picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_a69684fd}

This was a great ctf as I got to pick up the tool, "dirbuster"!
