We have to guess logon for user, joe

Failed logins to "Joe" return:
  I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way. 

Trying using burp suite's intruder to brute force the login with rockyou.txt file. Which will take forever, so started looking into other ways of doing this.

Trying to see behaviour for other login attempts, it looks like it doesn't check passwords for any other user.
  Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though. No flag for you

Inspecting the cookies, we can see in plain text the values for username and password, as well as admin being False.
Switching the admin value from False to True and refreshing got us the flag!

Flag: picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_6edb3f5f}
