When decoding the cookie value, "amswZEo4VFU1S1ZNWU9aQStPc2owb0VEZlppVDEzbjE0d0NpdkYzZzdjUFowYTcveXQ0N2VmczRFRE9sb0JVYXk4OWtpYzhpZGFFaHdIWXluYWRjdnhoZzdJTndEQVhwUVBsZnZCWWNmZ3VtZS9yWmdzcXRjb1FFdHBRWXFtQ3k=" on the web page, we get gibberish.
This is likely because the cookie is still encrypted. 

Oddly enough, the "C" "B" and "C" are capitalized in the challenge description, probably hinting at cipher block chaining. Research into CBC homomorphic encryption (part of the hint we get from this challenge), we can find that CBC is vulnerable to bit flipping which is explained in https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66085/bit-flipping-attack-on-cbc-mode

Thankfully, there's also provided python code for this attack, as long as I can add some lines in a script to apply the attack for my specific use case. Ran into some issues here... Need to improve my python skills lol, brb
