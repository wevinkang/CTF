Here we can use Burpsuite's battering ram in Intruder to brute force the cookie value to find the flag. 

$ is the value we will be brute forcing with GET requests for /check directory.
  Cookie: name="$"

Since the cookie value is numerical, we will select Numbers for our payload type. 
We can test different ranges, but was able to get on first try with from 0 to 25.

Once we start our brute force attack and check the lengths of each response, we can see payload 18 had an anomalous length of 1265 relative to the other responses that had a length of 1930 to 1950.
Examining the response shows us that cookie 18 gave us the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_88acab36}
