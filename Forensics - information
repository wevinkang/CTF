Use "exiftool" tool to inspect information on the cat.jpg. Under License, we can see there is a collection of letters and numbers that appears to be base64
encoded so we will use the following command to decode it:
"echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d"
This command then gives you the flag.
