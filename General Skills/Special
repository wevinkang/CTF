Connecting to the provided server gives us a strange Shell that jumbles up our commands and does not allow us to navigate properly.

Ended up using the following to execute commands in this peculiar shell, "${parameter='command_here'}"

${parameter=ls}
(Shows us the blargh directory)
${parameter=ls blargh}
(shows us flag.txt)
${parameter=cat blargh/flag.txt}

Flag: picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_6a2763f6}
