Using the python script provided we can add to it to provide us the password by matching the hashed password against the provided password list. 

Had to end up looking for the solution online, but learned about splitlines function in Python.

Adding the following to the end of the provided script and running it, provided us the password to capture the flag.
pw_list = open('dictionary.txt', 'r').read().splitlines()

for pw in pw_list:
    if hash_pw(pw) == correct_pw_hash:
        print("The password is: " + pw)
        break
