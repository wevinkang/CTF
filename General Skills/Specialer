Again like the "Special" challenge, we can't use all commands such as ls, cat, etc.

Tabbing twice shows us all the commands we have access to and the most useful for us in this challenge will be cd and echo.
Typing in cd and then tabbing twice is similar to executing ls and can show us which directories or files are in our working directory. 

Now we have to find another way to cat files to find the flag, doing a quick search, we can simply use the following command to print text from a file, "echo $(<text.txt)"
Using our tools, we navigate through each directories files, to try and enumerate the flag until we get to the directory, "/home/ctf-player/ala" and execute the following
'''
Specialer$ echo $(<kazam.txt)
return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78}
'''

Flag: picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78}
