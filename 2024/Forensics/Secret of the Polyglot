Downloading the supposed pdf file gives us what looks to be an incomplete flag:
```
1n_pn9_&_pdf_2a6a1ea8}
```

Went to the command line to further check the file's contents:
``` bash
cat flag2of2-final.pdf
```

The file shows a lot of gibberish, but the first word is, "PNG"
So pivot to changing the file extension of flag2of2-final.pdf to flag2of2-final.png then opening the file gives us the rest of the flag: 
```
picoCTF{f1u3n7_
```

Flag: picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_2a6a1ea8}
