We need to recover the file in which contains the flag.

$ cd drop-in
$ ls
  Enumerates the message.txt file that no longer contains the flag.
$ ls -la
  Enumerates .git directory.
$ cd .git
$ ls | grep -d recurse pico   
  logs/HEAD:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 b562f0b425907789d11d2fe2793e67592dc6be93 picoCTF <ops@picoctf.com> 1710201983 +0000  commit (initial): create flag

Here, I tried to see if I could just search through all the directories and files in .git to find the flag quickly but couldn't. Though we did enumerate some key information that may lead us to the flag.
We can see the commit ID where the user removed the flag from the file, now just need the following command to revert the message.txt file.

$cd ../
  cd back to /drop-in
$ git checkout b562f0b425907789d11d2fe2793e67592dc6be93
$ cat message.txt 
  picoCTF{s@n1t1z3_c785c319}

On retrospect we also could've done the following.

$ cd drop-in
$ git log 
  Shows the previous commits and shows where user removed flag.
$ git checkout b562f0b425907789d11d2fe2793e67592dc6be93
$ cat message.txt 
  picoCTF{s@n1t1z3_c785c319}

Very interesting one, as I was less familiar with Git commands.
