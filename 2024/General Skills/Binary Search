10 tries to guess a number between 1 - 1000, and tells you higher or lower if you get incorrect.

My method was to start with 500, then continue guessing the average number between the min and max each time.
Example, guess 500, outputs incorrect, lower. Guess 250 next and so on. Searching up the Binary Search methodology, it's similar to how I guessed the number.
