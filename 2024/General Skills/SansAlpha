$ ssh -p 53781 ctf-player@mimas.picoctf.net

Unable to use any letters for commands so had to do some research into special character or number commands. Came across, https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm

$ ./*
  bash: ./blargh: Is a directory
$ ./*/*
  bash: ./blargh/flag.txt: Permission denied
We found the flag's path relative to where we are right now, but we don't know the full path.

$ /???
  bash: /bin: Is a directory
$ /????
  bash: /boot: Is a directory
$ /?????
  bash: /lib32: Is a directory
$ /??????
  bash: /libx32: Is a directory
Brute forcing this, I eventually found:
$ /????/??????????
  bash: /home/ctf-player: Is a directory
Going to try matching with blargh to confirm the full path.
$ /????/??????????/??????/????????
  bash: /home/ctf-player/blargh/flag.txt: Permission denied
At least now, we know we're in the /home/ctf-player directory and full path of the flag.

Eventually had to throw the towel in and research a hint as I wasn't getting anywhere. Someone had the idea of using the /bin/base64 command.
$ /???/????64 /????/??????????/??????/????????
  /bin/base64: extra operand '/bin/x86_64'
  Try '/bin/base64 --help' for more information.

Have to somehow exclude x86_64, which we can do by using [!_]
$ /???/???[!_]64 /????/??????????/??????/????????

Plugged this into cyberchef and finally returned,
return 0 picoCTF{7h15_mu171v3r53_15_m4dn355_4945630a}

Flag: PicoCTF{7h15_mu171v3r53_15_m4dn355_4945630a}

Honestly, this one was the hardest flag I've tried so far. Had to find the solution online, https://medium.com/@niceselol/picoctf-2024-dont-you-love-banners-40b8c1fc5050

Learned special character command uses.
