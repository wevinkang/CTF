Method 1: Download the file, "warm" and transfer it into a Linux computer (I use Kali Linux). Use the "cat" command on terminal to display the contents of the file. Near the bottom displays the flag.

Method 2: Download the file, "warm" and transfer it into a Linux computer (I use Kali Linux). Make the file executable with:
"chmod +x ./warm"
execute the file
"sudo ./warm"

"sudo ./warm -hoh"

This gives the flag.
